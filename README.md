# Weather and Entertainment Consumption Analysis

# Dataset
This project will use my personal data from Spotify, Netflix, and YouTube, along with historical weather data. Here's a brief description of the datasets:
- Spotify Data: Contains dates with the information of what time I listened to songs and the titles of the songs.
- Netflix Data: Contains dates and titles of the content I watched.
- YouTube Data: Contains dateswith the information of what time I watched the video and their titles, and search history from my viewing activity.
- Weather Data: Historical weather data will be sourced from OpenWeather or a similar API. It includes daily temperature, and weather conditions.

# Project Idea
The goal of this project is to analyze how weather conditions influence my entertainment habits across platforms like Spotify, Netflix, and YouTube. For instance, I want to explore whether I watch more Netflix on rainy days or listen to upbeat music on sunny days. By combining weather data with my activity data. I want to find out how external factors are effecting my entertainment consumption. Additionally I might look from another side which is how external factors are effecting my overall entertainment consumption.


# Project Plan
Hereâ€™s how I plan to approach the project:
1. Data Preparation:
- Collect Spotify, Netflix, and YouTube data with date and time informations.
- Collect the historical weather data for the same dates using an API like OpenWeather.
- Merge all datasets based on matching dates. (Grouping datas from different sources will mostly based on dates)

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyze daily and weekly (hourly if I can collect the relevant informations) trends in entertainment consumption.
- Identify differences in my habits during sunny, rainy, and cold weather conditions.

End of this project, I aim to:
- Gain insights into how my entertainment habits change with weather conditions.
- Identify specific weather patterns that influence my entertainment consumption preferences .
- Create visualizations that effectively communicate my findings.
